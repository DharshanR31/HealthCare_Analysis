# Healthcare Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project delves into the analysis of healthcare data, focusing on hospital facilities, inpatients, and outpatients. By meticulously cleaning and analyzing this data, we aim to uncover valuable insights and trends within the healthcare sector. Leveraging data visualizations and data-driven analyses, the project sheds light on hospital performance, and patient flow patterns, and ultimately informs better decision-making for healthcare management improvements.

## Project Objectives

* Comprehensive Analysis: Analyze data encompassing hospital facilities, and inpatient and outpatient details to reveal key trends, patterns, and relationships within the healthcare system.
* In-depth understanding: Utilize data visualizations and in-depth analyses to clearly understand hospital performance, patient flow, and waiting list management.
* Data-Driven Decision-Making: Generate valuable insights to support informed decision-making and potential improvements in healthcare management.

## Dataset Description

The project employs a healthcare-related dataset containing information on hospital facilities, inpatients, and outpatients. Detailed data descriptions, including column names, data types, volume/frequency, and quality checks, can be found in the data directory.

## Requirements Gathering

* Stakeholder Identification: Establish a clear point of contact for each stakeholder group.
* Business Objective Understanding: Foster open communication through meetings and discussions to comprehend stakeholders' business objectives.
* High-Level Data Exploration: Deeply examine the data source, column definitions, data types, volume/frequency, and data quality to ensure data integrity and suitability for analysis.
* Scope Definition: Clearly document Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), timelines, and expectations within the project scope.

## Project Goals

* Patient Waiting List Management: Analyze historical monthly trends in the inpatient and outpatient waiting lists to track the current status and uncover patterns.
* Granular Analysis: Conduct detailed investigations based on patient specialty and age profiles to gain a deeper understanding and targeted actionable insights.

## Data Scope

The project analyzes data encompassing the period from 2018 to 2021.

## Metrics

* Average Waiting List: Calculate the average number of patients waiting on the inpatient and outpatient lists.
* Median Waiting List: Determine the median waiting time to provide a more robust understanding of central tendencies, potentially less sensitive to outliers than the mean.
* Current Total Waiting List: Capture the current number of patients waiting in both inpatient and outpatient lists.

## Views

* Summary Page: Provide a high-level overview of key findings, including:
    * Average and median waiting list times
    * Current total waiting list numbers (inpatient and outpatient)
    * Visualizations of key trends

* Detailed Page: Offer a granular view for deeper analysis, including:
    * Waiting list trends over time (inpatient and outpatient)
    * Breakdown of waiting lists by patient specialty
    * Analysis of waiting list patterns based on patient age profiles
